## Loading and preprocessing the data
data <- read.csv("./activity/activity.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data$date <- as.Date(data$date)


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}

stepsPerDay <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(stepsPerDay, binwidth=1000, xlab="Steps per day")

```

2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
print("Mean:")
mean(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)
print("Median:")
median(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
